# Snippy
Code for snippythelobster.com

A site that includes a number of tools I find useful, including word definitions and etymology, translation tools for learning Akkadian, and subscription/unsubscription services for a WOTD emailer.

This repo isn't meant to be readily replicated, and serves primarily as a backup. For a more user-friendly WOTD repo, see:
